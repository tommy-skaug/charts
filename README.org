--------------------


Backend-focused and UX optimized minmal charts built for use with deployments based on Flux. Generally 
contains Helm charts for infrastructure and some related to security operations.

This is a Helm Chart repository that provides packages for [[https://helm.sh/][Helm]], the Kubernetes
package manager. The builds are made available on GitHub Releases and on GitHub Pages. 

Some charts only have Docker images available somewhere else or built by me, and others have badly
implemented Charts which I've chosen to simplify: opinionated and minimal. Opinionated means that
they're adapted to [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/) and uses best practices such as [external-secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/). 

As with everything Kubernetes it is a learning journey, however, so feel free to open an issue.

Below you'll find an overview of the charts and an intro to get you started.

*** üìñ Overview

- [[charts/conduit][Conduit]]: An efficient and self-contained Matrix server using an embedded RocksDB 
  database.

- [[charts/attic][Attic]]: Nix Binary Cache server that reduces the time to compile and distribute 
  builds (introduction post [[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/introducing-attic-a-self-hostable-nix-binary-cache-server/24343][here]])

- [[charts/][Dispatch]]: A incident management and coordination system developed by Netflix.

- [[charts/foundationdb][FoundationDB]]: Distributed database with ACID transactions developed by Apple.

- [[charts/hasura-engine][Hasura]]: Connects to databases and services to provide a realtime GraphQL API.

- [[charts/netbox][Netbox]]: Modeling and docs for IP address management (IPAM) and datacenter 
  infrastructure management (DCIM).

*** Usage

**** Manual Installation

You can explore this repo by using the following commands if you have the Kubernetes package manager
 installed:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# add the package source
helm repo add 252 https://charts.252.no

# search for a specific chart
helm search repo dispatch
# or list all available charts
helm search repo 252 -l 

# show configuration options
helm show values 252/dispatch

# install a chart
helm install dispatch helm-charts/charts/dispatch --namespace=toolbox
#+END_SRC

**** As Code with FluxCD

First take care to setup the chart:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: 252-charts
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 15m
  url: https://charts.252.no
#+END_SRC

You can reference e.g. the Dispatch chart like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta2
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: &app dispatch
spec:
  interval: 30m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: dispatch
      version: 0.3.2
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: 252-charts
        namespace: flux-system
  maxHistory: 2
  install:
    remediation:

    remediation:
      retries: 3
