* Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts

Started on the repo of [ananace](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) and extended with various other charts I needed to adapt for my cluster. Charts are minimal and are stripped to only accept Secrets.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ helm repo add tommy-skaug-charts ghcr.io/tommy-skaug/charts
#+END_SRC

*** Ingress

The charts maintains the internal networking and you wire the connection to the outside world. I use two ingress classes: Tailscale and nginx, and you can wire a service by adding to kustomization and [[https://fluxcd.io/][flux]] e.g. like the following.

To expose publicly via nginx:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: matrix-synapse-ingress
  namespace: messaging
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: ingress.${PUBLIC_DOMAIN}
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: matrix-synapse
            port:
              number: 8008
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - matrix
#+END_SRC

To use the [[https://tailscale.com/kb/1236/kubernetes-operator/][Tailscale operator]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hajimari-ingress
  namespace: home
spec:
  ingressClassName: tailscale
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: hajimari
            port:
              number: 3000
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - apps
#+END_SRC
